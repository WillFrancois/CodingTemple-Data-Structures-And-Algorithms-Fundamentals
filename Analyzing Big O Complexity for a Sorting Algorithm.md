# Task 1

The provided algorithm is an example of Bubble Sort and attempts to sort an array by going over each element and comparing it against each other element until it finds its right place in the list and is sorted.

# Task 2

The algorithm's runtime is O(n^2) and increases exponentially with each new element added.

# Task 3

An improvement would be to use the built-in Python sorting function which uses Powersort as of version 3.11. If the algorithm needed to be written from scratch and needed to still be simple, Merge Sort is also a fine option. If the person implementing doesn't understand recursion, Quick Sort is also better on average.
